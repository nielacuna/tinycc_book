\chapter{Dynamic Arrays}
TCC makes extensive use of dynamic arrays. arrays that can regrow itself 
so it can accomodate more entries.

example of dynarrays:
        state->include\_paths
        state->sysinclude\_paths
        state->library\_paths
        state->crt\_paths
        state->files => dynamic array of filespec objects
