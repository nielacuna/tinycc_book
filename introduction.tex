exuberant ctags
will help with most of the symbols and functions, but TCC uses some tricks 
when generating defines that the ctags parser can not reseaonably pick up on. This is just how things 
are done inside the TCC code base and when encountering cases like the one mentioned above,
one can turn to some good 'ol code sleuthing using tools like find and grep and sometimes, 
just painfully comb through each one of the source codes looking for the answer.
